Q1. Write a JAX-WS web service to perform the following operations. Define a Servlet / JSP 
that consumes the web service. 
 
Step 1: Create a new project. Click on web application (Categories:Java Web) (Projects: Web Application) Name of project  Next  Finish.

Step 2: Once your project is successfully created. Expand your project (From left side 'Projects tab'), right click on project. 
Select New  Web Service. Enter the name of new Web Service as operation (Web Service Name : abc or Ram ws) & package 
name as com.kk ( Package : com.kk ). Click on Finish options. 

Step 3: Once your web service Created. Remove the selected part from Operation.java (remove unnessaray already existing data from public class abc{  remove this data  })

Step 4: Now go to the project palate. Expand your project, Go to the web services  
Operation. Right click on Web service, select Test Web Service. ( left side in Project Palate inside ApplicationName->Web Services->webservice )

(Click on Design their u can add Operations : on right side add operations)
Step 5: Add Operations. The first operation is Addition. 
Operation name is Add. The return type will be integer( type : int). Add some parameter. 
Now here I am taking two parameters.  
Parameter name is a & type will be integer. 
Parameter name is b & type will be integer. After that, click on OK  button. 

Step 6: Now the declaration of variable. 
Int c = a+b; 
Return c; 


Step 7: Now repeat, the Step 4 & 5 for creation of Subtraction, multiplication & division 
Operation. 


Step 8: Now, write the following code for subtraction, multiplication & division method. 
Subtraction method: 
int c = a-b; 
return c; 
Multiplication method: 
int c = a*b; 
return c; 
Division method: 
int c = a/b; 
return c; 

Step 9: Deploy Web Service 
Right click on Web Application and deploy

Step 10: Now test your web service. 


Step 11: Now right click on project. Select New  JSP page. Give the file name & click on 
Finish. 

Step 11: Write the following code in JSP page. 
<% 
com.kk.PramodWS a1 = new com.kk.PramodWS(); 
int d = a1.Add(3, 6); 
int e = a1.Sub(45, 26); 
int f = a1.Mul(23, 3); 
int g = a1.Div(64, 6); 
out.println("Addition of two numbers is: "+d+"<br>"); 
out.println("Subtraction of two numbers is: "+e+"<br>"); 
out.println("Multiplication of two numbers is: "+f+"<br>"); 
out.println("Division of two numbers is: "+g+"<br>"); 
%> 

Step 12: Now right click on JSP page page. Click on Run file.

Q2. Write a JAX-WS web service server & client to perform the following operations. Define 
a servlet/ JSP that consumes the web service. 


Step 1: Create a new project. New project  Java Web  Web Application. 

Step 2: Right click on newly created project. Create a new web service. The service name is 
PramodWS2 & package name is rc.com. 

Step 3: Remove the selected content from PramodWS2.java 

Step 4: Write the following code in deleted content. 
@WebMethod (operationName = "Square") 
public double square (double val) { 
return val*val; 
}

Step 5: Now go to the palate. Right click on index.html in project. Click on run file

The following window will open after run your index.html file.

Step 6: Remove the selected part from link. (remove this : /Prac1JAXWS-SC/index.html ) (keep just :http://localhost:8080)

Now, the below window will open. 

Step 7: Click on go to the administration console. 
The following window will open. 

Step 8: In left side panel, expand the Application task. Click on your project. 

Step 9: Go to the general(on rightside). Scroll down the page, there is one table which name is Modules & 
Components. In action column, click on View Endpoint. 

Step 10: Click on /Pramod248637_Using_Client/PramodWS2?wsdllink. 

Step 11: When you click on link. The View WSDL window will open

Step 12: Click on first link which will provide the access of server.

Step 13: Copy the link from search engine to notepad. (copy url thats on top of browser eg:http://shinchann:8080/Prac1JAXWS-SC/ServiceClient?wsdl)

Now minimize the Microsoft edge window. 
Step 13: Create a new Java project.( Categories:Java , Projects: Java Applications )

Step 14: In Java Application project, create a new web service client. 
Right click on project  New  Web Service Client 

Step 15: In new web service client. Select wsdl URL. Paste the copied link.

Step 16: Open JavaApplication.java. Type the following code. 
PramodWS2_Service service = new PramodWS2_Service(); 
final PramodWS2 proxy = service.getPramodWS2Port(); 
System.out.println(proxy.square(7)); 

Step 17: Now import the service packages.

Step 18: Run the Java application project.
